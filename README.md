🎓 EDU Tour – Career Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview
EDU Tour is a web-based intelligent career guidance system that helps students choose the most suitable academic and career paths based on their personal interests. Using advanced deep learning models and a user-friendly interface, the platform recommends tailored fields of study, degree options, and professional roles.

🚀 Features
🔐 User Authentication – Secure registration and login system using Flask and SQLite.
🎯 Dual-Interest Mapping – Students select two interests; the system dynamically maps them for accurate recommendations.
🤖 LSTM-Based Prediction – Career paths are predicted using a trained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
🧠 Intelligent Interest Validation – Real-time validation using AJAX ensures only logical combinations are accepted.
📊 Result Visualization – Clearly displays the suggested field of study, degree, and job roles.
🛠️ Feedback Mechanism – Allows users to provide feedback for continuous improvement.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Database: SQLite
AI/ML: TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM, CNN models)
Other Tools: AJAX for real-time validation, LabelEncoder for input/output translation

🧱 System Architecture
The system consists of:
User Interface Layer – Interactive forms for input and feedback.
Backend Processing – Encodes input and manages data flow between components.
Prediction Model – Hybrid deep learning model (LSTM + CNN) for accurate recommendations.
Database Layer – Stores user data, interest mappings, and logs.

✅ Testing & Results
✅ Functional, non-functional, unit, integration, and system testing performed.

⚙️ Achieved ~87% prediction accuracy.
⏱️ Average prediction time: under 2 seconds.
🧪 Tested with over 200 valid interest pairs.

🔚 Conclusion & Future Scope
EDU Tour simplifies the career decision process with an engaging and personalized approach. The platform bridges the gap between student interests and real-world opportunities.

Future enhancements:
Expand interest mappings
Support multilingual and mobile interfaces
